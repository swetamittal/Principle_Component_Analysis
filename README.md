# Principle_Component_Analysis(PCA)

Principle Component Analysis(PCA) is a technique which is udes to reduce dimensionality of the dataset having multiple correlated variables. The degree of correlation may vary for each variable to another variable. The reduction process tries to minimise the loss in the variation of the datatset. The principal components are the eigenvectors of a covariance matrix, and hence they are orthogonal.
